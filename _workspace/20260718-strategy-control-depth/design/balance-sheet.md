# Frozen Stage 2→3 balance sheet

**Design contract only; no production/test changes and no measurement run.** `campaign-state.js` rules v6 remains current.

## Gate dispositions (director owns final verdict)

## Reward-family decisions (designer acceptance of PM bounds)

All rewards remain earned campaign state. Premium/free/edition/cosmetic deltas are **0 percentage points** for combat power, tempo, access, controls, tactical information and authoritative traces.

| Family | Frozen bound | Existing effects at issue | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cooldown/tempo | **8–15% effective reduction per pick; ≤40% cumulative; minimum cooldown fraction 60%.** `autoExtract` consumes 10 pp of tempo budget; any pick bundling it has ≤15% cooldown reduction. | `cooldownMultiplier`, `autoExtract`, live clamp currently 50% | exhaustive reward stacks; effective clipped value logged |
| Possessed burst | **+1…+3/pick; ≤+4 cumulative; no pick >75% cap** | `possessedAssaultBonus` current max +8 | assault-count/TTK by S5–10 |
| Materialize legion | **+1…+2/pick; ≤+4 cumulative; one action summons ≤6; empty capacity 10 needs ≥2 decisions** | `materializeBonus` current max +8 | setup-action count/capacity clamp |
| Counter | **−1/pick; ≤−3 cumulative** | `counterReduction` | counter floor/late attrition |
| Aegis/Domain | persistent entry aegis **≤2**; total stage-available aegis including Domain **≤3**; Domain one earned use, restore **≤4 integrity**, grant **≤2 aegis**, instant reversal **≤30%** | `entryAegis`, Domain S10 +4/+3 currently | before/after outcome window and reversal rate |
| Targeted recovery | +2 target must realize **≥1 effective integrity in ≥80%** eligible entries or redesign | targeted integrity rewards/entry floors | clipped-value realization |
| Targeted vanguard | **+3…+4** to one named stage; saves **≤2 setup actions**; never satisfies node/possess/wave/Domain/assault gates | Veil Vanguard +4, Span Sigil +4 | target-stage setup counts |
| Echo Throne rewards | **commemorative; exactly 0 combat/tempo effect**, plainly labeled | current empty `effects={}` while campaign continues | reward-screen comprehension; zero trace delta |
| Gate Zenith rewards | terminal commemorative **0 forward combat effect** | terminal empty effects | copy/trace audit |
| Whole-build diversity | combo max/median **≤1.30** (warn >1.20); clear-time p50 spread≤20%; equal-skill build win spread≤10pp; normalized choice entropy≥.75; zero-effect selection≤5% | durable v7 early 12-pair max/median **1.1559×** | full all-stage stratified builds still required; freeze score/seeds first |

## Isolated Echo Throne probe disposition

**APPROVED as the integrated G2 candidate; rejected as a standalone release retune.** The `/tmp` one-family probe that motivated SD-021 changed Echo Throne `commands.assault.counter.baseDamage` **8→6** and moved seeded casual **40.0%→51.0%/200**, with Echo Throne defeats **78→49** and deterministic fuzz **150,000/0 findings**. Rusher/comeback remained **0%** and greedy/optimal **100%**, so the probe did not pass G2 or G3. The `8→6` value has since landed only inside rules v7 under SD-021; retention still requires the full matchup/TTK matrix and ≥3 independently viable archetypes.

No boss HP, reward source value, or boss-damage value beyond the SD-021 Echo counter `8→6` is authorized. Retune one numeric family at a time; retain only changes restoring the full G2 band without breaking the G7 loop model or determinism.
